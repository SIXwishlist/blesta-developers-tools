# Blesta Developer Tools

Tools to make the life of a Blesta module/plugin/gateway developer easier.

## To Use

Run `console.php` and pass in the following:

* `-t <template>` the template used to generate the extension
* `-n <name>` the name of the extension

The above are required.

## Possible Templates

All templates are located inside of the `templates/` directory.  Write now the following exist:

* `plugins` - Write a Blesta [plugin](https://docs.blesta.com/display/dev/Plugins)

## TODO

* Support other extension types
* Add in additional developer tooling (super vague right now)
* Support [Blesta Composer usage](https://github.com/blesta/composer-installer)
